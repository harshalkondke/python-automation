# py-Automate 

I have used python as well as batch programming to automate the stuff such as creating new folders and starting the same project on my github and then open the same folder in pycharm(my fav IDE)

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install pyGithub
```
## Setup 

> Create.bat

move create.bat into your system32 folder. tip: you can rename the file so that the custom command on cmd will as your choice.

> CreateNewProject.py

You can keep this file anywhere yo want. but make sure you added the new path of this file to create.bat. 

## Usage

```batch 
create <project-name>
```

## Contributing
I know a lot of stuff which is in bat file can be written in python file as well and the speed can increased. but i am to lazy to do that now. feel free to make changes or make it more fast.
